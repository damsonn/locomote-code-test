# Locomote code test

This is a small code test for Locomote

## Prerequisites

You should install **node**, I tested it with version `5.3.0`. As it uses ES6 features, you will need a version at least > 4.

## Usage

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

it is easier to also install mocha and node-static globally

```
npm install -g node-static mocha
```

Runs the question 1, 2 and 3

```
mocha question*.js
```

question 4

```
static question4
```

and then open [http://localhost:8080/tab-panel.html](http://localhost:8080/tab-panel.html) in your browser
